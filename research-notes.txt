Raw Notes from Observational Study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 
Time of the Day: 3:30 PM to 4:30 PM 

- Questions on Insurance coverage for the prescriptions 
- Patient may be on a wheelchair 
- Pharmacist calls out patient's name when the medicines are ready (but what if patients have hearing disabilities, what about accents or wrong name pronunciations, can it lead to miscommunications or delays?) 
- Patients have to wait in line when they first visit 
- sometimes patient may not be in the waiting area when their names are called out. They may go for tests/visit the cafeteria or simply go outside in the lobby area and wait there with other family members. 
- usually the wait times are probably around 20 mins (maybe more or less) and is given immediately if the prescriptions are readily available  
- patients (or their nurse/fam member) have a name and a case number that they share so pharmacists can retrieve details/prescriptions 
- patients may read books, spend time talking on the phone, spend time on social media, or use YouTube/OTT platforms while they wait  
- Pharmacists ask for Name, DoB, ID, address before giving out the medicines, patients also need to sign at the end after picking up the medication  
- environment is pretty well lit, there is that usual medicine smell, the waiting area is not noisy. There are mulitple posters to download their med management app. The area also mentions the rights that patients have. There is a tv but it's switched off. There's sanitizer as well. Entrance has a big enough title indicating that this area is a pharmacy. There is an evacuation plan stuck to the wall.  
- Questions on allergies  
- Patients receive a Bag with medicines which is sorta sealed with a rounded tape. There's no handle on the bag 
- Questions on if  Pharmacists have the patient's case on file  
- Patients have to remember (what seems like) a case number - it's short so easy to recall but I've heard patients mention longer numbers, I wonder what that's for 
- patients usually have bags that they're already holding (could be a backpack, purse) 
- Seating capacity is 13-15 people. 7 chairs and a central sofa. They're pretty comfortable. They're all in Blue. The whole color scheme is blue/white/brown 
- There is a medication disposal bin but needles aren't allowed. There are clear instructions about its usage in English and Spanish. There are 7 bullet points and each point is 2-3 lines long.  
- patients may not only speak in English but also in maybe Spanish 
- There's a CCTV camera for security  
- People may wear masks or may not - it's not mandatory  
- Counters have a protective glass and are separated by other glasses. Patients can still hear conversations and interactions of other patients. So there's no privacy (incase the patient is hesitant about mentioning the medicine out loud for any reason) 
- it's about 4 in the afternoon and the range of patients waiting or in line at a time has been around 1-8. The waiting time in line was less than 5 minutes with 6 counters. 
- Patients don't really pay attention to the posters. maybe when they're waiting but I haven't seen anybody actively stand and read any poster  
- There are moments when nobody's at the counter but it's for really short negligible times.  
- Questions about waiting times, some medicine might be available later/on a later day. Some are good for only certain days so patients clarify that 
- There are indoor plants 
- Physical receipt. no mention of emailing receipts or even asking patients if they want an electronic one 
- Some may have multiple prescriptions and maybe some are ready but other's arent 
- There's a dedicated area for patient counseling 
- Have a prescription but first consider if the medication fits the budget. They may look for other options if not 
- Some received a vague instruction like - pick up the medication for their friend and they were a bit confused as to what to do, what information do they need etc but this doesn't seem to be a problem as the pharmacists do seem to have the relevant information or the process to retrieve the information
